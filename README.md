# Designing a PDF Audiobook using Python
In this code, a simple implementation of Audiobook with PDF Reader is shown. PDF text is read to the user as audio using this code.

#### Introduction
Reading stories or essays or any text can be arduous, however an audio reading of the text is convenient and doesnt require as much concentration as reading requires. In this project, I implemented a simple PDF to audio converter. This code scans page(s) of PDF and reads it using audio, to the user. While this project is good for simple text reading, it does not perform good if a scientific paper with equations is given to it because equations are not supported to be read in pytesseract OCR library which we used to convert image to text.
